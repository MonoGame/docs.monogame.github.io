title: Advanced 2D Shaders in MonoGame
description: A tutorial series on creating advanced 2D visual effects with custom shaders in MonoGame.
---

This tutorial series picks up where the [Building 2D Games](./../../building_2d_games/index.md) tutorial left off, diving deep into the world of custom shaders. The goal is to develop tooling for MonoGame to facilitate shader development, write some custom effects for _DungeonSlime_, and build intuition for how to approach shader programming.

## What We Will Build

Throughout this series, we will take our _Dungeon Slime_ game and add a whole new layer of visual polish. By the end, you will have implemented a variety of advanced shader effects, including:

- A scene transition effect,
- A color swap effect,
- A 3d effect using `SpriteBatch`,
- A lighting system using techniques from deferred rendering,
- A shadow system using stencil buffers.

![_Dungeon Slime_ will look like this at the end of this series](./videos/final.mp4)

## Who This Is For

This documentation is for intermediate MonoGame users. It assumes that you have a solid understanding of C# and have _already completed the entire "Building 2D Games" tutorial series._

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The concepts and code from the original tutorial, especially the [Shaders](./../../building_2d_games/24_shaders/index.md) chapter, are a mandatory prerequisite. We will be building directly on top of the final project from that series.

## Table of Contents

This documentation is organized to be read sequentially, as each chapter builds upon the techniques and code from the previous one.
