This is a guide on setting up your development IDE for creating games with MonoGame using Visual Studio Code. By following this guide, you will learn how to install the necessary tools for developing C# applications and configure Visual Studio Code with recommended extensions for C# development.

By the end, you will be fully equipped to start creating games with MonoGame using Visual Studio Code.

## Install Visual Studio Code

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

1. Open your web browser and navigate to [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

    ![Download VSCode](./images/1_setting_up_your_development_environment/vscode/windows/download-vscode.png)

## Setting up VS Code for development with MonoGame

1. Open Visual Studio Code
1. Open up its terminal window (`Ctrl` + `` ` ``)
1. Run the following command to install MonoGame Templates

    ```sh
    dotnet new install MonoGame.Templates.CSharp
    ```

> [!TIP]
> Alternatively, consider using the Preview Packages provided by MonoGame to get access to the latest developments.

## Install Visual Studio Code C# Extensions

To transform Visual Studio Code from a simple text editor into a powerful development environment for C# projects, you must install the Visual Studio Code C# extension. This extension enhances the editor by providing syntax highlighting, code analysis, IntelliSense, and other features that significantly improve the development experience and productivity when working with C#.

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Click the **Extensions** icon in the **Activity Bar** on the left.

    ![Click Extensions](./images/1_setting_up_your_development_environment/vscode/click-extensions.png)

3. In the **Search Box** type `C#`.
4. Click **Install** for the **C# Dev Kit** extension.  Installing this will also install the base **C#** extension.

## (Optional) Install the "MonoGame for VSCode" extension

A community member has built a VSCode extension for VS code to enable:

- Automatically install MonoGame templates
- Create new projects from the file menu or command palette
- Open the MGCB editor with the click of a button (very useful)

You can find this extension by following the steps above and searching for "MonoGame for VS Code" by r88.

> [!NOTE]
> While not built by the MonoGame team, we regularly use this extension ourselves and fully support it.

## (Optional) Install the ".NET MAUI" extension to help with mobile development

This extension is provided by Microsoft and is built on top of the C# and C# Dev Kit extensions. They will be installed as dependencies if they were not already installed. While primarily designed for MAUI development, it provides essential mobile debugging capabilities that MonoGame mobile projects can utilize.

The .NET MAUI extension adds features for building mobile apps, including:

- F5 debugging support - Debug your MonoGame mobile apps on emulators, simulators, and physical devices
- Easy target switching - Change debug/deploy targets between different mobile platforms
- Enhanced C# Dev Kit integration - Leverages Solution Explorer, Test Explorer, and advanced language features

> [!NOTE]
> This extension is recommended if you wish to do iOS or Android development. It is required for debugging support when working on mobile games. 


## Creating a new MonoGame project

1. Open up an empty folder in Visual Studio Code
2. Open up its terminal window (`Ctrl` + `` ` ``)
3. Run the following command to create an empty project for desktop platforms:

    ```sh
    dotnet new mgdesktopgl
    ```

4. Once the files are created, open up the `Game1.cs` file and wait a second for the C# extension to load
5. You can now press F5, select C# and then your projects name if Visual Studio Code asks you, and it should start up your brand new game!

## Update Project Tool references

The MonoGame Content Editor (MGCB) it a tool delivered through NuGet for your project using the tools configuration held in your `dotnet-tools.json` file (located in the `.config` folder of your project).

Once you have created your project you should run the following terminal/command-line command to ensure the tool (and the pipeline) is setup and read for your project:

```dotnetcli
    dotnet tool restore
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you ever change the version of the tools or want to upgrade them by editing the `dotnet-tools.json` configuration, you MUST run this command again to update te tools.
