## Update Project Tool references

The MonoGame Content Editor (MGCB) it a tool delivered through NuGet for your project using the tools configuration held in your `dotnet-tools.json` file (located in the `.config` folder of your project).

Once you have created your project you should run the following terminal/command-line command to ensure the tool (and the pipeline) is setup and read for your project:

```dotnetcli
    dotnet tool restore
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you ever change the version of the tools or want to upgrade them by editing the `dotnet-tools.json` configuration, you MUST run this command again to update te tools.
