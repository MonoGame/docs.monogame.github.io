## Overview

The code in this topic shows you the technique for detecting and using multi-touch gestures. You can download a complete code sample for this topic, including full source code and any additional supporting files required by the sample.

MonoGame supports multi-touch gesture-based input on Mobile. The primary class that provides this support is [TouchPanel](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input.Touch.TouchPanel), which provides the ability to:

- Designate which gestures should be detected.
- Query to see if any gestures are available for processing.

> [!NOTE]
> Gesture support is provided as a convenient subset of the features possible on a multi-touch input device. For more information about general multi-touch programming, see [Working with Touch Input](HowTo_UseMultiTouchInput.md).

## How to detect Gestures on a multi-touch Screen

1. Set the gestures to enable with [TouchPanel.EnabledGestures](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input.Touch.TouchPanel). This can be one value, or a combination of values, in the [GestureType](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input.Touch) enumeration. Performance can be decreased by enabling all gestures, so it is a good practice to enable only the gestures you will be using in your game.

2. During your game loop, check to see if any gestures are available with [TouchPanel.IsGestureAvailable](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input.Touch.TouchPanel.IsGestureAvailable). When [IsGestureAvailable](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input.Touch.TouchPanel.IsGestureAvailable) is **false**, there are no more gestures in the queue.

3. If gestures are available, call [TouchPanel.ReadGesture](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input.Touch.TouchPanel) to get a [GestureSample](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input.Touch) that contains the data for the gesture.

> Some gestures will be preceded by another gesture that begins the gesture. For instance, a **DoubleTap** gesture is always preceded by a **Tap** gesture. For more information about the various gesture types supported, see [GestureType](xref:Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input.Touch).

## Example

The following code illustrates the procedure for detecting gestures on a multi-touch screen.

- Enabling gestures in the game's constructor:

    ```csharp
    // set up touch gesture support: make vertical drag and flick the
    // gestures that we are interested in.
    TouchPanel.EnabledGestures =
        GestureType.VerticalDrag | GestureType.Flick;
    ```

- Detecting gestures in the game's Update method:

    ```csharp
    // get any gestures that are ready.
    while (TouchPanel.IsGestureAvailable)
    {
        GestureSample gs = TouchPanel.ReadGesture();
        switch (gs.GestureType)
        {
            case GestureType.VerticalDrag:
                // move the poem screen vertically by the drag delta amount.
                poem.offset.Y -= gs.Delta.Y;
                break;

            case GestureType.Flick:
                // add velocity to the poem screen (only interested in changes to Y velocity).
                poem.velocity.Y += gs.Delta.Y;
                break;
        }
    }
    ```
