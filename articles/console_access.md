description: How do I get access to console versions of MonoGame?
---

MonoGame is free to use on all platforms from the [public repository](https://github.dev/MonoGame/monogame), but the code for supporting console platforms is only accessible to authorized console developers.

These platforms are provided as private code repositories that add integrations with the console vendor's APIs and platform specific documentation.

## Application process

The process for access to the private console repositories is as follows:

1. Apply to the vendor developer program (required for publishing).
2. Through the program, request access to the MonoGame console repositories.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The MonoGame Foundation cannot directly give anyone access to the private console repositories without prior approval from the vendor due to NDA requirements set out by each vendor.

The instructions below will help you gain access to each platform.

## Nintendo Switch

Your first step is to register as [Nintendo Developer](https://developer.nintendo.com/register) for Nintendo Switch.

Once you are in the program, you can go to the middleware page and fill out the [MonoGame - Nintendo Developer Authorization](https://developer.nintendo.com/group/development/getting-started/g1kr9vj6/middleware/monogame) form.

We will then contact you with further instructions.

Once you are active in the program you can email `idsetup@xbox.com` and copy the MonoGame`console@monogame.net`account requesting Xbox Developer verification for access to MonoGame for Xbox.
